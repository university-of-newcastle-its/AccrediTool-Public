Design problems in mechatronics are often characterised by many interlocking design trade-offs and conflicting requirements. Engineers need to carefully balance design decisions that affect mechanical structure, power electronics, dynamic response, computational power, sensor and actuator choice, cost and development time. This is achieved in MCHA3400 by a combination of mathematical modelling of systems, system testing and implementation along with consideration of safety, reliability, availability and fault tolerance. This is particularly relevant in mechatronics applications including medical devices, aerospace and autonomous systems.",

It takes a systems engineering perspective and addresses the complex interplay, and the design and integration issues between the many subsystems of an aircraft. The course will cover important aspects of reliability, robustness, redundancy, validation and verification in the systems engineering process. The syllabus will contain substantial case studies to reaffirm these lessons with examples from incidents and accidents in aeronautical history. Students will gain experience from group activities involving systems engineering practice.",

The course considers the configuration design of a complete aerospace vehicle system at the conceptual stage to meet a pre-defined set of requirements. The course covers aerospace design regulations, design requirements, design cycles and the approvals process. It will draw together the background covered in aircraft performance, dynamics and propulsion courses to optimise the design of the aerospace vehicle to meet a set of requirements. The course will consider the integration of other subsystems, the implied requirements on those systems and the effects of subsystem requirements on the aerospace vehicle configuration. The course will provide students with opportunities to apply all of their aeronautical knowledge, to perform effectively in group activities and develop their team participation and management skills through a systems engineering process.",
